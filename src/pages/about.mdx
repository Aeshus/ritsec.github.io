RITSEC is a student-run organization dedicated to preparing students to become competitive professionals in the rapidly growing field of computing security.
We provide hands-on experience through competitions, weekly meetings, and independent student research.
Our program focuses on live individual and team-based security exercises spanning a wide range of computing security disciplines.

RITSEC is the result of the merger of RC3 (RIT Competitive Cybersecurity Club) and SPARSA (Security Practices and Research Student Association), completed in 2018.
