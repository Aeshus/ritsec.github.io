        ## Mentorships

        RITSEC provides both group and one-on-one mentorship opportunities.

        Each semester, mentees are connected with mentors, and learn together and build a collaborative project or work on more personalized learning.

        It is completely free of cost and provides an unmatched opportunity to learn.
