        ## Why Join an Interest Group?

        RITSEC's Interest Groups (IGs) are the heart of our technical depth. These are specialized, smaller communities within the club dedicated to specific domains of security.

        - **Deep Dives**: Move beyond the basics and tackle advanced topics.
        - **Hands-on Projects**: Build tools, solve challenges, and conduct research.
        - **Mentorship**: Learn directly from experienced students and alumni.
        - **Community**: distinct cultures and vibes—find the one that feels like home.

        Whether you're a beginner wanting to learn the ropes or an expert looking to innovate, there's a place for you.

        ## Mentorships

        RITSEC provides both group and one-on-one mentorship opportunities.

        Each semester, mentees are connected with mentors, and learn together and build a collaborative project or work on more personalized learning.

        It is completely free of cost and provides an unmatched opportunity to learn.
