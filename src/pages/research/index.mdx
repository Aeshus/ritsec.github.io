        ## Our Approach

        RITSEC isn't just about competitions; it's about contributing to the wider security community. We provide the platform, resources, and mentorship for students to take their curiosity to the next level.

        ### Presentations

        We encourage all members to share their knowledge. Research presentations are a core part of our weekly meetings and a low-stress way to practice public speaking.

        ### Blog Posts

        We also publish technical blogs, as well as cross-posting selected posts created by our members.
