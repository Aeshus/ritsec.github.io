      ## Getting Connected

      RITSEC lives on Discord. This is where we announce events, share resources, host workshops, and hang out. 
      
      We also have a free newsletter, that keeps you in the loop with club activities and events.

      ## Weekly Meetings

      We meet every Friday to discuss security topics, host guest speakers from the industry, and run hands-on workshops.

      It is highly recommended for new members to attend, and there is even free pizza.

      ## Frequently Asked Questions

      ### Do I need to be a Computing Security major?
      **No.** We have members from Software Engineering, CS, IT, and even non-technical majors. Security is a mindset, not just a degree.

      ### Do I need prior experience?
      **No.** We love beginners. The best way to learn is to show up, ask questions, and break things (safely) with us.

      ### Can I join if I can't come to meetings?
      **Yes.** A lot of our activity happens asynchronously in Discord, and interest groups are spread around the whole week.
