This is a place for RITSEC members to post about what they’re currently researching, cool projects, or anything RITSEC related. These posts contribute to the greater security community, so get your voice out there!

We also have a tiered rewards program to incentivize our members to share what they’re woking on! For members, 1 blog post is equivalent to one research presentation, and making blog posts will earn you prizes!
