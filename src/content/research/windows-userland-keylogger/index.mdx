summary: "As a part of RITSEC's mentorship program, four freshmen attempted to make a windows userspace keylogger. Each member worked on different functionality; deployment, keylogging, persistence, and keylog parsing. \n\nThe presentation shows what the group did, what kind of hardship and struggle the less-experienced freshmen group had to go through, and how they overcame it (kind of)."
