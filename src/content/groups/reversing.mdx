    ## About Reversing

    The plan for this semester is going to creating your own decompiler for ARM 64 from scratch that's the entire/only project for the semester and we will work on it incrementally throughout the semester.

    We'll start with reading ELF binaries, then (optionally) writing an aarch64 dissassembler, and then finally implementing the lifting algorithms from ASM to pseudo-c.

    We're expecting it to take a while!
