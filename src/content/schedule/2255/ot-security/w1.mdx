This semester, the OT Security Interest Group will be centered around GridSecSim, our hands-on Operational Technology (OT) security project.

If OT sounds intimidating or unfamiliar—that’s completely okay. You’re not expected to come in already knowing industrial systems. This group is designed to help you learn OT security from the ground up, in a supportive, hands-on environment where curiosity matters more than prior experience. If you’re interested in security beyond traditional IT and want to explore something new, this is a great place to start.
A little bit about what we’ll be doing this semester:
Working with a simulated OT environment with VMs, containers, and real ICS equipment like PLCs
Researching and exploring blue team and red team techniques within OT Security in the environmentAfter speaking with over 8 professionals across the OT security industry, we now have a clear direction for where the interest group—and GridSecSim as a whole—is heading, and we’re excited to start building toward that vision this semester.
About the IG leads this semester:
Lucas Brown (me) will continue leading the OT Security Interest Group and helping with the development of GridSecSim. This summer, I will be interning with IBM X-Force in DC.
Alex, one of our IG leads, recently returned from a co-op with Nestlé Nespresso in Barcelona, where he worked on security initiatives in an international enterprise environment.Lukas May will be joining us virtually this semester while on co-op with FM, conducting OT/IT security research.
