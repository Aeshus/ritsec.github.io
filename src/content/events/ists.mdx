RITSEC’s premier collegiate competition where student Blue Teams defend a corporate network while doing so much more. There is purple team activity where teams must simultaneously hack their competitors in a King of the Hill battle. There is an ISTS CTF going on as well, to give competitors the ability to hack even while off-site. Last but not least, there's a custom game and narrative that goes along with every competition.
